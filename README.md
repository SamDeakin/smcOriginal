# smcOriginal
A patched version of the original smc tool by devnull

This is what I could find of the original smc.c and smc.h created by devnull in 2006. I couldn't find the original tool anywhere so this will be a recreation of it.

The original tool had a couple bugs which will be fixed, and poor support for printing floats, which will be added in.
